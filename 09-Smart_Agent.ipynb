    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We loaded a vector-based index with large/complex PDFs information , \"cogsrch-index-books-vector\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",
    "- **Notebook 08**: We used another ReAct Agent in order to talk to the Bing Search API and create a Bing Chat Clone and implemented callbacks for real-time streaming and tool information\n",

      "To answer the question, I first needed to set the pandas display options to show all columns and get the column names. I used the `pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)` to show all columns and `df.columns` to get the column names. Then, I used two different methods to get the number of rows in the dataframe: `df.shape[0]` and `len(df)`. Both methods gave the same result of 20780. Therefore, the final answer to the question \"how many rows does the file have?\" is 20780.Thought: \n",

      "To get the number of rows in the dataframe, I used two methods. First, I set the pandas display options to show all the columns and then used the `len()` function on the `index` attribute of the dataframe to get the number of rows. This gave me a result of 20780. However, I wanted to make sure that there were no missing values in the column that we will use to count the number of rows, which is the 'date' column. So, I used the `isna()` method on the 'date' column to check for missing values, which gave me a result of 0. This means that there are no missing values in the 'date' column. Finally, I used the `notna()` method on the 'date' column to count the number of non-null values, which gave me a result of 20780. Since both methods gave the same result, I can be confident that there are 20780 rows in the dataframe.Thought: I need to set the pandas display options to show all the columns\n",
